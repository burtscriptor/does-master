so i tried to deploy on heroku using my old mates mthod of creating the build for the frontend
and copying and pasting it to the server folder public, theres a line in server.js that directs the 
server to the public folder

the deployed version sent an error 500 interal server
this could be from openai or it couod be from my server and i'm not sure
how to workk out where the issues originates at this time

so i think next steps are to make a new branch called deploy
so i can make all kinds of changes in there, then to strip out the calls to openai
and see if my sever responses with a simple json without issues.

ok so i tried to put some console logs in the back end but they did get through

so i blanked out the backend request to openai and managed to serve up dumbhy json data to the
front end. 

Now to try and serve up the raw response from openai to the frontend, ie not send it to split/removeChars
to rule out if the problem is orginating from there.
- so still got the same error so it seems it is from the openai get request
now i am trying the opennotify api for astronauts, this test will help me to determine
if it is the configuartion of my server setup
ok and the open notify api worked successfully and sever data to the frontend!
so its somthing to do with openai and possibly the apikey

so i think i did tryy to add env to the heroku app but maybe i got interrupted? and 
didn't see it through but i'm not sure it matters becaue did i had the apikey to the space 
station heroku account? - no i didn't and it still manged to serve up the api key interesting



To deploy on vercal

we need to create a frontend env and back env and adjust
the appripatae calls and responses to use the urls from the .env file
than deploy backend and in the env section declare the frontend env but initals with placeholder
xx
than deploy the frontend and in the env section declare the backend url and use the vercel address
than update the backend deployment env section with the http:...frontend delpylment address
